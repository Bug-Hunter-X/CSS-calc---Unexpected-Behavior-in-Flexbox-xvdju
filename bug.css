The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes lead to unexpected results if used incorrectly. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` inside a flexbox item may not behave as expected if the parent container's size is not fixed. This is because `calc()` is evaluated after the flexbox layout is calculated, so the parent's size might not be accurately determined until after `calc()` is processed.
